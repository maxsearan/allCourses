Modify the Counter control to sentinel control for the average example

Develop a class averaging program that will process an arbitrary number of grades each time the program run.
Use a sentinel (signal | dummy | flag) value to indicate the end of data entry.

Initialize total to zero
Initialize gradeCounter to zero
Input the first grade (possibly the sentinel)
While the user has not as yet entered the sentinel Add this grade into the running total
Add one to the grade counter
Input the next grade (possibly the sentinel)
If the counter is not equal to zero
Set the average to the total divided by the counter
Print the average
Else
Print “No grades were entered”
