1. Open a text editor, open worldTimetxt.html document. 
Enter your name and the date in the head section as a <meta> tag 
and save the file as worldTime.html. 
Add the Document type declaration for HTML5 and the related tags in the <head> element.
2. Open timeZonextxt.js, enter your name and the date in the comment section,
and save the file as timeZones.js.
3. Within the timeZones.js file, create a function named addTime(). The purpose of the addTime() function is to create a new date object by adding a specified number of milliseconds to an initial time value. The function has two parameters, named oldTime and milliseconds. The oldTime parameter stores a data object representing an initial time value. The milliseconds parameter stores the amount of time, in milliseconds, that should be added to the oldTime parameter. Add the following commands to the function:
a. Create a date object named newTime, but do not specify a value for its date or time.
b. Using the getTime() method, extract the number of milliseconds contained in the oldTime parameter and add this to the milliSeconds parameter. Store the sum in a variable named newValue.
c. Using the setTime() method, set the time value of the newTime date object to the value of the newValue variable.
d. Return the newTime date object from the function.
4. Below the addTime() function, create a function named showTime(). The purpose of this function is to return a text string showing the time in a 12-hour format. The function has a simple parameter named time, which contains the date and time that you want displayed. The showTime() function should return the following text string:
hour: minute AM/PM
where hour is the hour value in the 12-hour format, minute is the minute value, and AM/PM is either “AM” or “PM” depending on the time of day.
5. Save and validate the timeZones.js document.

 6. Go to the worldTime.html file in your text editor. Above the closing </head> tag, insert an external script element to access the functions you created in the timeZones.js file and then insert an embedded script element.
7. Within the embedded script element, create a function named worldClock(). The purpose of this function is to calculate the time in different time zones. Within this function, do the following:
a. Create a date object variable named today equal to the current data and time.
b. Apply the getTimezoneOffset() method to the today variable to calculate the offset of your computer’s clock from UTC/GMT in minutes. Change this value to milliseconds. Store the result in a variable named offset.
c. Call the addTime() function using today as the first parameter value and offset as the second. Store the value returned by this function in a variable named universalTime. The universalTime variable represents the current data and time in Greenwich.
d. Calculate the current data and time at Jackson Electronics’ first office (Houston). To calculate this value, call the addTime() function with universalTime at the first parameter and the second parameter equal to the number of milliseconds that Houston is offset from universalTime. (Hint: Since Houston is 360 minutes behind Greenwich, the offset from universalTime is equal to (-360) * 60 * 1000). Store the date object returned by the addTime() function in a variable named time1or houstonTime. Repeat this step to create variables named time2 through time6 for the other five office locations using the offset values that David has indicated in the list above.
e. The current times for the six office locations are to be displayed in input fields named place1 through place6 in the zones Web form. To display the value of the place1 field, call the showTime() function using the time1 variable as the parameter value. Repeat this step for the five remaining input fields.
8. Add an event handler attribute to the <body> tag to run the worldClock() function when the page is loaded by the browser and every second thereafter.
9. Save your changes and close the file.
10. Open worldTime.html in your browser. Verify that it shows the current time for the six office locations and that these times are correctly offset from Greenwich.
