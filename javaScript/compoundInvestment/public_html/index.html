            /** Consider the following problem statement:
             A person invests $1000.00 in a savings account 
             yielding 5 percent interest. Assuming that all 
             interest is left on deposit in the account, 
             calculate and print the amount of money in the 
             account at the end of each year for 10 years. 
             Use the following formula for determining 
             these amounts:
             
             a = p (1 + r)^n
             
             Where
             p is the original amount invested (i.e., the principal)
             r is the annual rate,
             n is the number of years, and
             a is the amount on deposit at the end of the nth year 
             
             This problem involves a loop that performs the 
             indicated calculation for each of the 10 years 
             the money remains on deposit **/

            var p = 1000;//p is the original amount invested (i.e., the principal)
            var r = 0.05;//r is the annual rate
            var n = 10;//n is the number of years
            var a;//a is the amount on deposit at the end of the nth year

            function fNyears(p, r, n) {
                return a = p * Math.pow((1 + r), n);
            }
            a = p;
            for (var i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
                a = a * (1 + r);
                document.writeln("<h2> The amount the " + i + " is " + a.toFixed(2) + " $</h2>");
            }
            //verification
            document.writeln("<h2> The amount the is " + fNyears(p, r, n).toFixed(2) + " $</h2>");

            var fontSize = 1;
            while (fontSize <= 7) {
                document.writeln("<p style='font-size:" + fontSize + "ex'> HTML5 font size" + fontSize + "ex</p>");
                fontSize++;
            }
